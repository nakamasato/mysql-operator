# API resources

- API resources are defined in `api/<version>/xxx_types.go`.
- Manifest file for `CustomResourceDefinition` is generated by `make manifests` (`controller-gen`).
- `DeepCopy` is generated by `make generate` (`controller-gen`).

## `MySQL`

MySQL represents a MySQL cluster with root acess.

- Spec
    - adminUser
    - AdminPassword
- Status
    - UserCount

TODO:

1. Credential management.
1. Change to `ClusterResource` so `MySQLUser` in any namespace can reference it. (No need of changing `OwnerReference`)
    > Namespaced dependents can specify cluster-scoped or namespaced owners.

## `MySQLUser`

When `MySQLUser` is created/edited/deleted, MySQL user will be created/edited/deleted by the controller.

- Spec
    - MysqlName
    - Host
- Status
